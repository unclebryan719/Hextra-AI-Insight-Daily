### Cutting-Edge Research
1.  **Alibaba Damo Academy** has dropped a tech report for **Tongyi DeepResearch**, an **Agentic LLM** specifically designed for those long-haul, deep-dive information search missions. This model boasts an innovative end-to-end training framework, blending Agentic pre-training and post-training phases, allowing it to ace complex reasoning and information retrieval tasks. The cool part? It can synthesize massive datasets without needing pricey manual annotation. With a whopping **30.5B** parameters, **Tongyi DeepResearch** has hit SOTA (state-of-the-art) levels in multiple Agentic deep research benchmarks. [The open-sourcing of its model, framework, and complete solution will greatly empower the community (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24701).
2.  **SEER**, a new benchmark introduced in a recent paper, aims to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to pinpoint specific emotional expressions in text. Instead of simply tagging an entire sentence, **SEER** tests an LLM's capacity to locate the exact text span that conveys emotion. Research shows that while some models come close to human-level performance on single-sentence tasks, their accuracy dips when tackling longer paragraphs, revealing issues like over-reliance on keywords. [Providing a more refined evaluation tool for the field of emotional computing (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03490), **SEER** is pushing AI to better grasp the subtle nuances of human emotional expression üí°.
3.  **LongWeave**, a new benchmark, has been launched by researchers to tackle the challenge of generating long, information-rich, and factually accurate text with LLMs. It cleverly balances real-world queries with verifiable evaluation needs. This benchmark uses a "**constraint-validator evaluation**" method, making sure tasks are both realistic and objectively measurable. It can rigorously assess a model's ability to generate long text while meeting complex real-world constraints. Evaluations of **23** mainstream LLMs show that [even the most advanced models face significant challenges when dealing with real-world complexity and long outputs (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24345), highlighting a vast room for improvement in this domain ü§î.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
