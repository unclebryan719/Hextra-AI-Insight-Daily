# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025* 📅

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By cruising through or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to these terms. Cool? 👍

## 1. Our Services Explained
So, what do we offer? Well, the Site is all about providing you with awesome paid subscription content and member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even some cool community interactions! Just a heads-up: some of this good stuff is only for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- **User accounts** require you to set up a password and provide a valid email address.
- You're totally responsible for **your account's security** and all the hustle and bustle happening under it. Seriously, **NO transferring or sharing your account**. That's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate your account** if you breach these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscriptions: The Lowdown 💸
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All payments go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal), so don't sweat it – **we don't store your payment info**. Phew!
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our services within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bailing. Each user gets this one-time refund shot. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, **payments are non-refundable** unless the law explicitly says otherwise.

## 4. Content & Intellectual Property Rights 🧠
- All original content you find here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or commercial use, alright?
- As a user, you get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** this content strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- Got big plans for commercial use or quoting a bunch of our stuff? **Hit us up first** to get authorization!

## 5. User Conduct: Play Nice! 🤝
- **You absolutely CANNOT** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't even think about it.
- **Bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-only content** through technical means? Also a big fat **NOPE!**
- The Site has the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Hiccups 🚧
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or pull the plug on any or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes.
- If, for some reason, you can't access content due to things like force majeure, server issues, or a third-party service going kaput, **the Site isn't liable for any damages**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer: Read This! 🛑
- The info we dish out on the Site is purely for your reference, and it **DOES NOT** constitute any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). So, don't take it as gospel!
- For any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services, **the Site ain't responsible. Period.**

## 8. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution ⚖️
- These **Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Got a beef arising from or related to these terms? You and us should totally try to sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't fly, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.
