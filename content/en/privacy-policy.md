But just a heads-up, we might need to keep certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data ü§´

### Security of Your Personal Data üîí
**The security of your Personal Data** is super important to us! But remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we totally bust our chops using commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Kiddo Privacy üë∂
**Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13.** We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to yank that info from our servers.

**If we need to rely on consent** as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires consent from a parent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites üîó
**Our Service might have links to other websites** that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

**We've got zero control** over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
